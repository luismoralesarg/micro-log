I want to share a personal project I've been working on: micro.log

It's a minimalist micro-journaling app designed for frictionless daily journaling. The idea is simple: write bullet-style entries, track ideas, record dreams, and collect learnings — all stored locally on your machine.

Key features:
• Daily Log with #tags and @mentions support
• Dreams module to record and track your dreams
• Ideas with status workflow (new → in progress → done)
• Wisdom section to collect quotes and lessons learned
• Insights dashboard with stats and activity graphs

What matters most to me: Privacy First — no accounts, no cloud, no tracking. Your data stays on your machine.

Available as a desktop app (macOS, Windows, Linux) or directly in your browser.

Tech stack: React 18, TailwindCSS, Vite, Electron

Repo: https://github.com/luismoralesarg/micro-log

If you're into journaling or personal productivity apps, I'd love for you to try it out and let me know what you think.
